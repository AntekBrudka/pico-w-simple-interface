# pico-simple-interfaceSimple interface for Raspberry Pi Pico WUI created for Waveshare 19650 1.3 Inch LCD display![IMG_20231114_162720](https://github.com/AntekBrudka/pico-w-simple-interface/assets/45321229/82d0aec9-42c3-4acf-a6c7-a677e6bd8ba9)                           ## Aim of the projectThe original purpose of this project was to "hang" pico with display on the wall, thus allowing users to check information fast and without unnecessary costs.## DesignUI consists of four screens:### Main screen : ![IMG_20231114_162749](https://github.com/AntekBrudka/pico-w-simple-interface/assets/45321229/bcd954d2-d2a6-404b-8cf8-19635ab5754c)### Weather screen :![IMG_20231114_162845](https://github.com/AntekBrudka/pico-w-simple-interface/assets/45321229/0b449cef-5a5e-4488-87b0-c7dadb86617f)### Free games available on the Epic Games site:![IMG_20231114_162540](https://github.com/AntekBrudka/pico-w-simple-interface/assets/45321229/a3efacdb-599b-4f33-88f9-f5f7fbbc0eda)### Basic info:![IMG_20231114_162933](https://github.com/AntekBrudka/pico-w-simple-interface/assets/45321229/96854458-8bc8-4932-8356-3ca8cb9edca7)## UsageButtons on the right side of the screen are used for navigation (A for main, B for weather, X for games, and Y for basic info). It is worth noting, that the value displayed in the upper right corner of each tab is a temperature from the onboard sensor, hence, it is not very accurate. Screensaver is set to turn the display off after 5 minutes of inactivity. In order to refresh external data, the programme will automatically reset the device after one hour. ## InstallationBefore moving files to pico three things should be passed into the secrets.py: - Network SSID - Network password - OpenWeather key (easily obtainable from their site)In the next step, all files from this repository should be saved into Pico's memory.## DisclaimerAlthough it is possible to fill the whole screen with an image, it is not recommended because of memory restrictions.
